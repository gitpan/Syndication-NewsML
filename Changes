Revision history for Syndication::NewsML

  v0.04 - Released to CPAN, 26 Sep 2001

    - Added resolveTopicSet, resolveTopicSetDescription to FormalNameNode
    These routines allow the user to, given a Status node or something else
    with a FormalName/Vocabulary pair, automatically look up a related
    TopicSet and get its information. Note that this only works for locally
    referenced TopicSets (ie in the same document referred by a Duid). The
    annotated DTD specifies an algorithm to use when the TopicSet can't be
    found locally -- I haven't implemented it yet.

    - Added References package including findReference method. Not tested
    for external references yet.

    - Added getElementByEuid and getElementByDuid methods. These methods can
    be used on any tag that inherits IdNode -- ie nearly all of them.

     Unfortunately the above methods only return a DOM element, not a NewsMLish
     object. Perhaps I can use the tag name to construct them?

    - Added DOMUtils class with two methods to begin with:
    findElementByAttribute(node, attr, value): starting at "node", walk the
    tree and return the node that has attribute "attr" with value "value".
    getRootNode(node) follow the path up from "node" and return a reference
    to the <NewsML> node at the top of the tree.

    - Added getDatePerl method to date elements: converts ISO8601 date/time
    format into internal Perl date/time format. Always returns date/time in
    UTC (it's easy to then use Perl localtime() to get a representation in
    another timezone). (Note: it may be useful to include a
    getOriginalTimeZone() or something as we're destroying a bit of
    information here: namely the timezone under which the story was filed /
    sent) Elements that can use this are: DateAndTime, FirstCreated,
    ThisRevisionCreated, DateId

    - Updated examples/NewsMLParser to use getNewsItemList -- forgot to fix
    in 0.03

    - Changed all references of News::NewsML to Syndication::NewsML

    - Added getTagName method to all Nodes

    - Added getPath method to all Nodes

  v0.03, released 16 Sep 2001

    - Released to newsml@yahoogroups.com mailing list only.
