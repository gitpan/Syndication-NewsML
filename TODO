TODO

    * Store catalogs for future use: eg <Role> tag should look up
    DefaultVocabularyFor "Role"...???
    * Allow creation/modification of NewsML documents as well as just
    reading them
    * A Syndication::NewsML::Simple type module that takes the pain out of
    accessing all these methods.
    * Better error checking
    * Better handling of error reporting -- don't just croak() every time
    something goes wrong
    * POD docs of each class (!)
    * Or at least some kind of class/method map so people know what they can
    call
    * Separate out the classes into more than one file!
    * Finish off t/4_reuters.t and examples/NewsMLParser.pl
    * Possibly change the way the constructor works... call it
    Syndication::NewsML::Parser?
    * The rest of the TODO list ;-)
  Would be nice
