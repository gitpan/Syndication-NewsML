TODO

=over 4

=item *
Allow creation/modification of NewsML documents as well as just reading them

=item *
A Syndication::NewsML::Simple type module that takes the pain out of accessing all these methods.

=item *
Better error checking

=item *
Better handling of error reporting -- don't just croak() every time something goes wrong

=item *
POD docs of each class (!)

=item *
Or at least some kind of class/method map so people know what they can call

=item *
Separate out the classes into more than one file!

=item *
Finish off t/4_reuters.t and examples/NewsMLParser.pl

=item *
Possibly change the way the constructor works... call it Syndication::NewsML::Parser?

=item *
The rest of the TODO list ;-)
