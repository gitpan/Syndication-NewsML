=head1 Syndication::NewsML -- a NewsML library for Perl

=end text

NewsML is a standard format for the markup of multimedia news content, ratified by the International
Press Telecommunications Council (http://www.iptc.org). According to the newsml.org website NewsML is
"An XML-based standard to represent and manage news throughout its lifecycle, including production,
interchange, and consumer use."

NewsML differs from simpler standards such as RSS in that RSS sends B<links> to stories, where NewsML
can be used to send links or the story itself, plus any associated information such as images, video
or audio files, PDF documents, or any other type of data.

NewsML also offers much more metadata information than RSS, including links between associated content;
the ability to revoke, update or modify previously sent stories; support for sending the same story in
multiple languages and/or formats; and a method for user-defined metadata known as Topic Sets.

Syndication::NewsML is an object-oriented Perl interface to NewsML documents, allowing you to manage
(and one day create) NewsML documents without any specialised NewsML or XML knowledge.

=head1 LATEST VERSION AND WHAT'S NEW

The latest version is 0.07, released 11 January 2002.

Download: http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/B/BQ/BQUINN/

=head2 What's New:

=over 4

=head2 v0.07 - Released to CPAN 11 Jan 2002

- Added some generic methods to Syndication::NewsML::Node (and therefore all
 object classes):

=over 2

=item o
getXML -- return the current tag and all its children as an XML tree
getContent -- same as above, but ignores the current container element
(which means the resulting string may not be well-formed XML)

=item o
getText updated to get text of all children (bug fix)

=item o
getAllText -- return text in all child elements with no sanity checking,
so you can even call this on the NewsML root element to retrieve all text
in a document

=back

  Thanks to Peter Hilbring for giving me the prodding required to get this
 done :-)


=head2 v0.06 - 1 Nov 2001 (unreleased)

- Enhanced examples/NewsMLParser.pl: now recurses through all NewsComponents.
 It's almost useful!

- Made auto routines handle undefined elements/attributes better: now returns
 undef rather than croaks. Calling a method of an undef class still dies,
 though: that's Perl, there's nothing I can do about it -- so test your return
 codes.

=head1 INSTALLING Syndication::NewsML

The lazy way to install Syndication::NewsML:

   $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
   cpan> install Syndication::NewsML

Or the normal way:

Retrieve the latest copy from CPAN: http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/B/BQ/BQUINN/

   $ perl Makefile.PL # Creates the Makefile
   $ make             # Runs the makefile
   $ make test        # Optional (See Interopability below)
   $ make install     # Installs Syndication::NewsML into  your Perl library location

With this method you will first have to install the pre-requisite module XML::DOM.
See L<what are the prerequisites?>.

=head2 What Are The Prerequisites?

=over 4

=item * 

XML::DOM (Have not tested lower than v1.27) 

=item *

Perl5 (Have not tested lower than v5.6) 

=back

To get the latest versions of the prerequisite module you can simply type this at the command prompt:

   $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
   cpan> install XML::DOM

or if you just 'install Syndication::NewsML' the CPAN module should automagically install all of the prerequisites for you.

=head2 What Systems Does It Work With?

Syndication::NewsML B<should> work on any machine that supports XML::DOM, and any filesystem including Windows,
although I haven't tested it on Windows yet. It's still early days, so expect some bugs.

=head1 WHERE ARE THE MANUALS?

Once you've installed, you can type: 

   $ perldoc Syndication::NewsML

=for html
<P>Or you can view them starting from here:
<A HREF="News-NewsML.html">Syndication::NewsML</A>,

=head1 GETTING HELP

The best place to ask questions now would be the NewsML mailing list at
B<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newsml/>, or ask
me directly at brendan\@clueful.com.au. If there is enough demand we may start up a specialised list.

General Perl/XML questions should be asked on the Perl-XML mailing list, which you can find at
B<http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Browse/Threaded/perl-xml>

=head1 THE TEST SUITE & INTEROPERABILITY

The standard C<make test> test suite checks most elements in a small range of test NewsML documents
obtained from the Net. You can find the test documents in the C<t/test_data/> directory.

I haven't written complete unit tests yet (after all there are 127 classes), so some methods remain
untested. However the test documents include a fairly standard range of elements, so you should be able
to get somewhere with the methods that work so far.

=head1 BUGS and TODO

There are probably bugs all over the place -- this is still an early version.

At the moment, C<Syndication::NewsML> only reads NewsML files -- in the future it should be able to modify and
write them as well.
